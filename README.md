ArduinoMusic
============

The code for my Arduino and Raspberry Pi powered music player

You'll need to install pyserial for this to work, and be running cmus. You can configure how it connects to cmus in the player.py file, along with where your Arduino is. 

This code probably has a few bugs still, and needs a lot more features to be complete, but it works!
